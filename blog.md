## About Me

Hi, my name is **Flora**. I will be a junior, majoring in computer science, this upcoming fall semester.

**Hobbies:** Any art-related activites (drawing, painting, crafting, etc.), taking a walk

**Interests:** Maybe back-end development? Web and app development

*This is my first time learning how to use Github. So far, it is slowly coming together. Github doesn't seem hard than I thought it would be.*
